# Face-detection
This Python program demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and displays the video feed in a Tkinter GUI window. It utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame captured from the webcam. Detected faces are outlined with rectangles on the video feed displayed using PIL and ImageTk libraries.

**Key Features:**
- **OpenCV Integration:** Utilizes OpenCV for webcam video capture and face detection.
- **Tkinter GUI:** Provides a simple GUI using Tkinter to display the live video feed and a close button to exit the application.
- **Real-time Processing:** Continuously updates the video feed with detected faces highlighted in real-time.
  
**Usage:**
1. Ensure a webcam is connected and accessible.
2. Run the script to launch the GUI.
3. Click the "Close" button to exit the application and release the webcam.
